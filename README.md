# Virtual Pet

Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to them. Maybe you just aren't allowed one in your flat.

To solve these problems, we're going to make our own <strong>JavaScript Virtual Pet</strong>.

## Getting Started

Create new repo in GitHub entitled <strong>virtual-pet</strong>.<br/>
Create new directory ```mkdir``` on your machine, also entitled <strong>virtual-pet</strong>.<br/>
Initialise a new NPM project here ```npm init```.<br/>
Install our testing framework, Jest, as a development dependency ```npm install -D jest```.<br/>
Alter the ```package.json``` file so that the test value is "jest".<br/>
Get the SSH link for your repo, and link it to your local repository using ```git remote add origin {the ssh link you just copied}```.<br/>
Lastly, create a ```.gitignore``` file and add the line <i>node_modules</i> to it as we do not want this directory uploaded to GitHub.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you're good to go!
